#Define function:
# Add parameters so num1 and num2 a=could be recongnized in the equation.
def find_sum (num1, num2 ) :
    '''Finds the value of a two numbered sum'''
#Add Statement to show that num_sum equals the value of the sum.
    num_sum = num1 + num2
#Returns the value of the sum once answered.
    return num_sum

#define variables with 111 and 222 then printing it once the sum is answered.
my_sum = find_sum(111,222)
print (my_sum)
